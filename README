  What:         Emacs Initialization File (and Builder)
  Author:       Christopher Genovese
  Version:      2.5.5
  Update #:     260
  Last Updated: Wed 22 Dec 2010
  Tested with:  Emacs 23.2.1, 22.2  (Mac OS X 10.5.8)


* Introduction and Main Features

  This emacs initialization has grown over years of use, tweaking, and
  experimentation. Nonetheless, I've worked to maintain a useful
  organization that will make modification and sharing easier. Although
  it is a truism that everyone loves their own customizations, it's
  my hope (belief) there are features here that are generally useful,
  and I hope that others can benefit from this init file, in part
  or in whole.

  The following are some of the notable features. These are mostly small
  things, but I want to highlight them because they might be hard to
  spot in all this code. Detailed documentation for the features is
  given in the component files, linked to below.
  

    + Efficient Key Bindings

      Like many emacs users, I prefer to avoid mouse use
      as much as possible. I also try to avoid pinky
      extension in either hand. And I have attempted
      to configure commonly used operations to be
      as parsimoniously represented as possible and to
      make accessible as many commands as possible.

      The keybindings here are, I think, quite efficient
      and memorable. Note for example: although \M-x works,
      I have alternate bindings \C-x\C-m and \C-c\C-m
      that are faster. I have moved help to \M-\C-h,
      which leaves the easy keys \C-h and \M-h for
      more commonly used operations delete-backward-char
      and backward-kill-word. Once you get used to that,
      you will never hit backspace again. Also, in
      most cases one can use \C-m instead of return,
      eliminating a common pinky stretch. \M-<space>
      (mark-sexp) is very useful even in text modes
      for grabbing and extending over reasonable
      units. Rectangles, bookmarks, abbrevs, tags,
      icicles, org, and several other commonly used
      features have their own sub-maps that are
      mnemonically arranged.

      See [[file:keybindings.el][keybindings.el]] for details.

      (Note: My quick-nav mode takes this farther for
      even greater efficiency.)

      See also the [[Note on C-w and M-k bindings][note]] below for an important issue
      with the keybindings.

    + Navigation

      Many of the builtin emacs movement commands issue errors at
      boundary cases (e.g., scroll-up near the beginning of the
      buffer). I have modified versions of these commands that
      avoid errors and "do what I mean".

      See file [[file:move-funcs.el][move-funcs.el]] for examples.

    + Help Navigation

      The emacs help system is very nice, but to make it
      convenient it helps to have some navigation keys. \M-\C-h g
      takes you to the help buffer and g in the help buffer takes
      you back, leaving the help buffer where it was (q does the
      same while dismissing the help buffer). Various other
      keybindings in the help mode have been overridden to
      provide smooth navigation with a minimum of stretching or
      disruption.
      
      See file [[file:nav-modes.el][nav-modes.el]] for details.

    + Dired

      It took me many years to truly appreciate dired, but now
      that I have, it has more and more supplanted the shell for
      many commands. The key to this (excuse the pun :), I think,
      is some additional functionality that makes common
      operations easier. This is especially important for the
      case where subdirectories are listed in the same buffer,
      which is the default here, because the standard dired setup
      does not adequately support that case. With this in place,
      I can do much of what I traditionally did in the shell with
      dired, and more efficiently.
      
      See file [[file:nav-modes.el][nav-modes.el]] for details.
  
    + Shell Directory Tracking

      The tcsh shell has a directory stack feature that I've found
      very convenient. In particular, it is easy to keep track of
      and access directories on the stack. This is pretty old code
      but I've been using it continuously for years, so it's
      also very stable. Coming version will include a more general
      mechanism that I'm experimenting with now.

      See file [[file:shell-modes.el][shell-mode.el]] for details.
  
    + Ibuffer

      A nice (and flexible) default filter setup, some nice
      navgation bindings, and a function for classifying
      files in the IBuffer listing.

      See file [[file:aux.el][aux.el]] for details.

    + Icicles

      The icicles package is just terrific. I've added functionality
      to ease navigation in the completions buffer, to indicate
      results sorting, and to fix a problem with default strings.

      See file [[file:nav-modes.el][nav-modes.el]] for details.

    + SLIME

      Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs (SLIME) is a nice
      way to deal with various lisp dialects. Although there
      is a swank support through lein that does work with SLIME,
      it forces one to invoke swank externally and then connect
      using a different mechanism (slime-connect) than with other
      dialects. Here, I give an alternative interface that lets one
      add and modify lisp implemenations in a variety of ways,
      unifying starting and stopping across implementations.
      Clojure works directly this way, automatically connecting
      to swank from within emacs.

      See file [[file:prog-modes.el][prog-modes.el]] for details.

    + TeX

      Addition of commands and tags, including especially
      support for using make to construct documents.

      See file [[file:tex-modes.el][tex-modes.el]] for details.

    + ESS

      A simple customization (should be the default, I think) that
      makes it easier to work in an ess-mode buffer while
      evaluating expressions.

      See file [[file:ess-modes.el][ess-modes.el]] for details.

    + Some Useful Functions  

      The files *-funcs.el contain a variety of 
      emacs lisp functions that can be useful more
      generally. The file [[file:aliases.el][aliases.el]] introduces a
      few scheme/clojure style predicates and other
      function aliases. The file [[file:macros.el][macros.el]] has several
      common and other control-flow macros. The
      file [[file:import-funcs.el][import-funcs.el]] has the first version
      of an import facility for managing requires
      and autoloads (and other types of loads).
      It doesn't do everything I want it to yet
      but it is functional.

  Acknowledgements: This code has been written over
  many years, inspired by and sometimes with reference
  to a lot of code written by others in the emacs
  community. Thanks to all for the good examples
  and wonderful packages.

** Note on C-w and M-k bindings

   Besides the new and modified keybindings set here, there
   is an important difference between these bindings and
   the GNU defaults. In particular, the GNU default global
   map uses C-v/M-v for scrolling, C-w for killing the region,
   and M-k for kill-sentence, with beginning and end of buffer
   exiled to M-< and M->. From almost the beginning of my
   time with emacs, I've found these unnatural. Instead,
   I use the following:

         C-w     Scrolling down (or beginning of buf when close)
         C-v     Scrolling up   (or end of buf when close)
         M-w     Beginning of Buffer
         M-v     End of Buffer
         M-k     Kill region
         M-c     Copy region and save in kill ring

   There are some other differences from the default, of course,
   but these are the major thematic differences. I use all of
   these commands very frequently. Understanding
   that everyone likes what they are used, I'd urge you to
   try these; but if you want the defaults, there are only
   a handful of places where they are used. Search for
   "\\(?:[MC]-w\\|M-k\\)" in the main file. In the next
   version, I will include a new function, called
   use-gnu-scroll-and-kill-bindings, to rearrange these
   bindings to the GNU default theme. I will also introduce
   additional "intelligent" mark and kill commands, which
   I've developed for my quick-nav mode.


* Contents

  The file is [[file:crg-emacs-init.el][crg-emacs-init.el]] is the standalone ".emacs" file
  constructed from the other components in this directory. The
  compiled version crg-emacs-init.elc was byte compiled with
  Emacs 23.2.1. See [[Build and Installation][below]] for installation instructions.

  During startup, the init file is loaded, followed by the
  emacs-custom.el file in my-home-lisp-dir (e.g., ~/.emacs.d) and
  then my-env.el in my-home-lisp-dir, if it exists, for
  additional environment- or system-specific adjustments that you
  want to keep out of the main file. (For instance on Mac OS X,
  one can set the PATH environment variable here if you don't
  want to adjust ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist on your system.)
  (Note the file [[file:system-settings.el][system-settings.el]] in the main build can be used
  for a similar purpose.

  The [[file:crg-emacs-init.el][crg-emacs-init.el]] file is built from the other components
  in this directory using make. The file includes a hyper-linked
  table of contents (via linkd-mode) and extensive documentation.
  The [[file:Makefile][makefile]] is also documented, but here I will describe the
  main pieces that are used in a less terse manner.

  Files are roughly grouped by name according to the following
  patterns, matched successively (cond-like):

  |-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
  | Pattern         | Category                                            |

* Build and Installation

  1. Edit the keys in Config to personalize locations of files
     and directories, as well as various parameters.
  
  2. (Optional) You can add additional customizations to WhoAmI
     and add corresponding keys in Config. Config keys are of the
     form
  
         KEY: VALUE
  
     and these show up as __KEY__ in WhoAmI. The values will be
     substituted for the keys directly.

     The file WhoAmI is emacs lisp with Config keys in place.
     These keys will be substituted directly.

     Note that the variables that are currently defined in this
     file should *not* be removed as they are used later in the
     code. Take care when changing these definitions.
  
  3. (Optional) If you want to byte compile the init file, you
     should set the location of the emacs executable (make
     variable EMACS). The current setting is for installation
     on MacOS X because that's what I'm currently using.

  4. (Optional) You should also configure the executable paths
     for perl and python (variables PERL and PYTHON) in the
     makefile if these are in non-standard locations. (Note: this
     step will not be necessary in the next version.) You can
     also change the default install and archive locations
     (INSTALL and ARCHIVE, see the [[file:Makefile][makefile]] for details and more
     refined options.)

  5. (Optional) Only if you want to make the full archive, you
     should set the location of the emacs executable (EMACS) and
     the directories of the various lisp libraries (EMAPP_LIB,
     EMACS_LIB, LOCAL_LIB) and the location of the build
     directory (EMACS_INI), as described in the makefile.
  
  6. See [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] for build and installation options. In short,
     you can get a byte-compiled initialization file by typing:
  
         make
         make install
         make clean
  
     at the shell prompt. (Verify successful compilation before
     proceeding to the second step. Emacs will give some
     compilation warnings, which you can probably ignore).
  
     To get an emacs-lisp source file, type
  
         make elisp
         make install INSTALL_SUFX=.el
         make fullclean
  
     This will install a .emacs file in  your home directory by default.
     You can edit the Makefile options to customize the build further.


* Current Requirements

I have tested this init file both explicitly and through long use
on Emacs 22 and 23, on both Mac OS X and Linux. Emacs 22 users
may wish to re-byte-compile the main file, as the version
included here was compiled with emacs 23.

This configuration takes advantage of several built-in and third
party modes/packages when they are available. Links to the source
for third party packages are given below. Most of these can be
obtained at http://www.emacswiki.org unless otherwise specified.
None of these is strictly required for the init file to work. The
packages that are referred to, directly or indirectly, are listed
below with version information.
