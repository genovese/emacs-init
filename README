* Installation

** Full Installation

   Clone the repository, either into a separate directory or
   into the init subdirectory of your .emacs.d directory.

   Run the installation script with a command like

   #+begin_src sh
     sh Extras/Install.sh --target=EMACSD_DIR
   #+end_src

   to install the code into EMACSD_DIR. This will install
   an initialization file in the user's home directory
   that will initialize the package system and load the
   installed code.

   Do 
   #+begin_src sh
     sh Install.sh --help
   #+end_src
   for more details on options.

   This script roughly does the following, with TARGET
   set by the --target option:
 
   1. Create directory $TARGET/init if it does not exist
   2. Recursively copy all files starting with a lower-caser letter
      from this directory to $TARGET/init
   3. Copy Extras/home-dot-emacs.el to ~/.emacs.el, transforming it
      based on the --package and --target options to set the package source.
      (This can be package, cask, or cask-homebrew)
   4. If $TARGET/site-lisp does not exist, create it and copy files
      from this site-lisp directory there.
   5. If $TARGET/themes does not exist create it and copy files
      from this themes directory there.
   7. If --cask is given and cask is installed, move to $TARGET
      directory temporarily and do cask install.

** Lightweight installation

   Clone the repository into your .emacs.d directory (or wherever
   you would like) and load  init/dot-emacs.el from your initialization
   file in any way you would like. This does not install any of the
   files in Extras.
