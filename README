* Installation

  Run the installation script. First invoke with --help to see the
  options:

  #+begin_src sh
    sh Install.sh --help
    sh Install.sh [...options...]
  #+end_src

  This does the following with TARGET (default ~/.emacs.d) set
  by the --target option:
  
  1. Create directory $TARGET/init if it does not exist
  2. Recursively copy all files starting with a lower-caser letter
     from this directory to $TARGET/init
  3. Copy Extras/home-dot-emacs.el to ~/.emacs.el, transforming it
     based on the --package option to set the package source.
     (This can be package, cask, or cask-homebrew)
  4. If $TARGET/site-lisp does not exist, create it and copy files
     from this site-lisp directory there.
  5. If $TARGET/themes does not exist create it and copy files
     from this themes directory there.
  7. If --cask is given and cask is installed, move to $TARGET
     directory temporarily and do cask install.
